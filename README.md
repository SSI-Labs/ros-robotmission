# ros-robotmission

This project showcases a fully autonomous robot designed to navigate a structured environment, identify and retrieve a specified part from an inventory zone, navigate through a series of obstacles, and deliver the part to a production line dropoff zone. The robot employs a front-mounted Anti-Collision bar that holds an electromagnet which allows the robot to pick up the part magnetically. The robot begins at its start location, travels through the enclosed space to the inventory zone, and uses the object recognition ROS2 package, [find-object](https://github.com/introlab/find-object), to detect and select the correct target part from a collection of options. The robot navigates to the part, centering it in the camera view, then engages the electromagnnet to pick it up. The robot then navigates to the red dropoff zone using color detection and object avoidance abilities, navigating through both static and dynamic obstacles along the way. After successfully driving to the red dropoff zone, the robot disengages the electromagnet to release the part, and backs up, indicating a successful mission.
Through intelligent navigation, robust part and color recognition, and collision-free transport, the robot demonstrates reliable execution of a real-world material handling task, adapted for use in constrained environments with limited mechanical complexity.
